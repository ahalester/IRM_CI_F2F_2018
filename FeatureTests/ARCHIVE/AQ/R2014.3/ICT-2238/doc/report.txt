Test Case #1: Bookmarking search results by default.

1. Click in Search button
2. Click in Results Bookmark
3. Expected Result:
   A bookmark should be showed by the exact state of the query and query results page, and be able to share this results page via a link.
   Verify that the URLs generated reproduce exactly the state of the results grid when it was bookmarked.
4. Passed: NOK (testcaste01-result.png testcase01-bookmark.png ICT-2238-TestCase01.html).
   We noted that for some default search the result is sorted by Release date ascendent (testcaste01-result.png) and the URL bookmarked is sorted by Release date descendent (testcase01-bookmark.png).

Other test cases are pending, because the behaviour was the same.
