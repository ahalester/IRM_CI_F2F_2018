*Test Case #1:* Having a Progress bar
1. Upload transitions file with DRM Tool.
2. You will see progress bar with statuses
3. Expected result: A progress bar instead of a busy sign: with the busy sign one never knows if the service has hung up. The best would be a progress indicator which says what it is doing at the moment.
4. Passed: OK (testcase01.png).
