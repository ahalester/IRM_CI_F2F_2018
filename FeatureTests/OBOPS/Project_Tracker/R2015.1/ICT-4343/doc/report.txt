Testing of Project Tracker
==========================

*Precondition*

- Add in /etc/tomcat7/tomcat7.conf and restart Tomcat
  export OBOPS_ZK_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=1
- Open DRM tool of Protrack http://laetitia.sco.alma.cl:8080/protrack with CAS account
- Using Mozilla Firefox v.13.0.1 (crc-xx of STEs)
- Using Mozilla Firefox v.30.0 (Latest version)
- Using Google Chrome 35.0.1916 (Latest version)

*Test Case #1: Generating ZK performance logging in Protrack*

1. Start the Project Tracker, log in, and interact a bit with it, clicking buttons, scrolling lists, opening/closing windows, etc.
2. Continue like this for 5 or 10 minutes. Repeat with all web applications if you want to double check, although one might be enough.
3. Expected Result:
   - After 5 minutes a "performance.log" file should be present under the tomcat's webapps/protrack directory.
   - The file should files where the content is separated by commas, and should contain:
        - Date/time
        - Request ID
        - Username
        - Client-side IP
        - Four time mesasuraments, expressed simply as numbers
        - Events information, if there is any
4. Passed: OK (performance_protrack.log ICT-4343-TestCase01.html).
