- Open AQUA https://2016-03.asa-test.alma.cl/webaqua with user CASA account (pmerino)
- Using Mozilla Firefox v.13.0.1 (crc-xx of STEs)
- Using Mozilla Firefox v.30.0 (Latest version)
- Using Google Chrome 35.0.1916 (Latest version)

*Test Case #1: Display the distribution of the Execution fraction per pointing in a Mosaic (or multi sources)*
1. Open Coverage Plot tab in AQUA. For examples,some multisource/mosaic with partial or full executions are:
{noformat}
   uid://A002/Xb06870/X6f2
   uid://A002/Xb06870/X6f2
   uid://A002/Xb06870/X6f2
   uid://A002/Xb06870/X6f2
{noformat}
2. Expected Result:
   - There will be observed fields with different colors.
   - Hint window when mouse is over the field shows expected execution time for expected fields, observed execution times and observed fraction for observed fields. Observed fields with different execution fraction will be shown with different colors.
3. Passed: OK (testcaste01.png).
