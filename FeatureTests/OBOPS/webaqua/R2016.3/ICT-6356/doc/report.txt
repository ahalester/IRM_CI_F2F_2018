*Test Case #1: AQUA GUI QA0: landing page improvements*
1. Go to WebAqua
2. Expected Result:
   - Search Tabs: QA0, QA1, QA2
   - The QA0 tab is initially populated with the most recent QA0 unset ExecBlocks from which Running ExecBlocks are excluded.
   - The ExecBlock list columns are: Project, SchedBlock, Duration, StartTime, QA0 State, EB UID. (Suzanna asked for this change.)
   - Below the ExecBlock list are quick filters for correlator, project type and QA0 status.
   - After changing any filters the search button must be pressed, there is no more automatic periodic search.
   - Clicking on the title "Advanced Search" will show additional search parameters (What used to be the manual search).
   - Clicking Reset will revert to the initial search parameters (BL, Science, Unset) and perform a new search.
3. Passed: OK (testcaste01.png).
