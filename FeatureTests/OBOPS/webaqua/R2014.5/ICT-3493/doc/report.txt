*Test Case #1: Plot of the pointing, add a Circle with a radius of 3 sigma*

1. Go to Manual Search tab
2. Go to ExecBlocks (QA0) tab
3. In Interval select Other
4. In From select some date of 2014/01/01
5. In To select the current date
6. In ExecBlock UID field input uid://A002/X77e1ed/X48
7. Click in Search button
8. Select the first result
9. Go to Plots > Pointing
10. In the Source select 0 - 0522-364@ALMA_RB_03
11. Expected Result: A graph should be shown with the following characteristics:
    - Pointing plots should include now a semi-transparent circle with the same color user to plot the points of the series it refers to
    - The circle should be centered in the centroid defined by the points that make up that series
    - The radius of the circle should be 3 times the standard deviation defined by the distances of each point to the centroid.
12. Passed: OK (testcaste01.png ICT-3493-TestCase01.html).

{color:red}Note: Some points are outside of the semi-transparent circle. Probably they are points outside of the average{color}
