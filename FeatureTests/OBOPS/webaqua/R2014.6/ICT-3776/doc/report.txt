*Test Case #1: QA0 report with QA0 comment*

6. Click in Search button
7. Select the first result
8. Go to ExecBlock tab
9. Click in Produce QA0 Report (HTML) and Produce QA0 Report (PDF)
10. Expected Result:
    - Final QA0 Comment should be shown in the panel
    - ExecBlocks that have a final QA0 comment set should show the same comment in the QA0 report, under the "Frequency" information
    - If no QA0 final comment has been set, or if it's empty, it should not appear on the report
    - The HTML version of the report might have a glitch, as the final comment's text might be vertically unaligned with respect to the "Final QA0 comment" label. This is due to a technical problem on the library we use to generate the reports, and something we will have to live with for the time being.
11. Passed: OK (testcaste01-aqua.png testcaste01_html-report.png testcaste01_pdf-report.png ICT-3776-TestCase01.html).
