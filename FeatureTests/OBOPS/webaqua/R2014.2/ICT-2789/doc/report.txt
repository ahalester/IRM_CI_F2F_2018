5. Expected Result:
   The ExecBlock lists should contain a new "Status" column.
   The column's contents should be the execution status of each ExecBlock, as recorded by the corresponding entry in the shiftlog tool.
   Sorting the column should be possible by clicking on its header
   When an ExecBlock is opened, the details panel should also show the execution status in a line reading "Status: <theStatus>", just above the "QA0 Status" line.
   A change in the execution status of an ExecBlock in the shiftlog tool should be visible in AQUA
