*Test Case #1: Showing a normal scrollbar in Phase tab*

1. Go to Manual Search
2. Interval: Other, From: 2014/01/01 12:00:00 AM To: 2014/01/31 12:00:00 AM and Search
3. Select the row ExecBlock UID: uid://A002/X77dfee/X79
4. Go to "Calibration Summaries" tab
5. Go to Phase tab and look at the baseline lengths tables
6. Expected Result:
   The table should have a title that reads "Baseline Lengths [m]".
   The table should be scrollable, if it takes more than the remaining available space of the page.
   If it's scrollable, the scrollbars should be fixed with respect to the page
7. Passed: OK (testcase01.png ICT-2733-TestCase01.html).

*Test Case #2: Showing a large scrollbar in Phase tab*

1. Go to Manual Search
2. Interval: Other, From: 2014/01/01 12:00:00 AM To: 2014/01/31 12:00:00 AM and Search
3. Select the row ExecBlock UID: uid://A002/X77dfee/X27
4. Go to "Calibration Summaries" tab
5. Go to Phase tab and look at the baseline lengths tables
6. Expected Result:
   The table should have a title that reads "Baseline Lengths [m]".
   The table should be scrollable, if it takes more than the remaining available space of the page.
   If it's scrollable, the scrollbars should be fixed with respect to the page.
   If the number of baseline is too large it is not possible to check all the matrix of BL. A slider should be added to allow the full visualization.
7. Passed: OK (testcase02.png ICT-2733-TestCase02.html).
