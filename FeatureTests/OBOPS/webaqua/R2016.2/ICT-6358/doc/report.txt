*Test Case #1: Calculate the execution fraction for that ExecBlock without errors*

1. Go to Manual Search tab
2. Go to ExecBlocks (QA0) tab
3. In Interval select Other
4. In From select some date of 2014/01/01
5. In To select the current date
6. In ExecBlock UID field input uid://A002/X822d50/X4dc
7. Click in Search button
8. Select the first result
9. Go to first tab and click in "Set QA0 Status" button
10. Select the "Pass" option for the QA0 status
11. Click on the "Explain result" link if available
12. Expected Result:
    - If no error occurs, the result of the calculation should be placed on the "Execution fraction" field, and the "Explain result" link should be visible
    - When clicking on the "Explain result" link, a new window should show up showing a table with the expected and actual values for the System Temperatures, Number of Antennas and Time on Source. Below the table a formula should show up, explaining how the final result is calculated. The result of the formula should come next, followed by the maximum allowed value. The final result should appear at the bottom, in bold font.
13. Passed: OK (testcaste01.png ICT-1327-TestCase01.html).
